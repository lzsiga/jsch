# jsch
Fork of jsch-0.1.55 of Atsuhiko Yamanaka (ymnk) from sourceforge.net

To tell the truth, I don't know anything about Java. Or git/github.
I only wish to publish a little fix I've created.

Licence: BSD

Java version: 1.5 or newer

Versioning: I think I'll start with **0.1.55a1**, not to interfere with other forks

Dependency: jcraft's jzlib (latest version is 1.1.3)
